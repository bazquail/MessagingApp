# MessagingApp
A Chat Server and Chat Client to send text messages!

To begin, run the main method in ChatServer. Then run the main method in ChatClient. This will create two instances of the chat client which connect to the
single instance of the chat server. It creates two chat clients to demonstrate app functionality between different users.

If I dedicate more time to this in the future, I will build a custom "Client" class to make handling data on the server less cumbersome.
